## Stale Branches to Clean Up

**Total local branches:** 110+  
**Recommended for deletion:** ~100 old feature branches

Many branches show `[origin/...: gone]` meaning they've been deleted remotely but still exist locally.

### Cleanup Commands

```bash
# Delete all merged branches
git branch --merged main | grep -v "^\*\|main\|modernization-2026\|tailwind-v4-upgrade" | xargs git branch -d

# Delete branches that are gone from remote
git fetch --prune

# Delete all local branches except these important ones
git branch | grep -v "main\|modernization-2026\|tailwind-v4-upgrade" | xargs git branch -D
```

**WARNING:** Review before executing! Some branches like `chore/react-19-upgrade` and `chore/tailwind-four-upgrade` might have useful history.

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Continue Modernization on Current Branch

1. ✅ Test Tailwind v4 visually
2. ✅ Update UPGRADE_NOTES.md
3. ✅ Merge tailwind-v4-upgrade → main

### Option 2: Merge modernization-2026 First

1. Create PR: modernization-2026 → main
2. Review & merge platform updates
3. Rebase tailwind-v4-upgrade onto main
4. Continue Tailwind v4 work

### Option 3: Clean Slate

1. Merge everything: tailwind-v4-upgrade → main (squash commits)
2. Delete all feature branches
3. Start fresh from main

## Files to Review

- `docs/modernization.md` - Upgrade guide
- `docs/UPGRADE_NOTES.md` - Change log (needs Tailwind v4 section)
- `package.json` - Dependencies updated
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` - Lockfile regenerated
- `components.json` - Tailwind v4 paths updated

## Questions to Resolve

1. **Merge strategy?** Squash commits or keep history?
2. **Branch cleanup?** Delete old branches now or later?
3. **Documentation?** Update UPGRADE_NOTES now or after testing?
4. **Testing scope?** Full visual regression or smoke test only?
